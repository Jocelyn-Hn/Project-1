# Project-1
CS II Project 1 for Final.

This project requires the selection of a previously completed
lab assignment and the expansion and improvement of its code
using concepts covered in the class.

QT Designer is used to provide a framework to produce a GUI
application.

Concepts that need to be included in the project files are:
- Validation of input received by application.
- Exception handling to deal with runtime errors.
- An intuitive GUI for application (in this case, QT Designer is used).
- Code organized with the help of classes or modules.
- Data stored in files/databases (for projects that will need to process/store data)
- Proper code documentation (descriptive variable names, docstrings for functions/methods.
  use of type hinting, and descriptive commit messages).
  
This is the first project required of two projects for the final semester project.
